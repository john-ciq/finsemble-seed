# Finsemble Seed Custom Dialog Using DialogManager API ExampleðŸŒ±
This example illustrates how to create a custom dialog by adding `DialogManager` API calls into a regular component.

# Creating
1. Modify a component
2. Update the contents of the newly created `index.tsx` file with the example code in `src\YesNoDialog\index.tsx`
3. Modify as necessary

# Running
1. Run the command `yarn dev`
2. Open at least one app
3. Save the current workspace
4. Move at least one of the open apps
5. Attempt to change workspaces, causing a workspace dirty check and prompt
6. Observe that the the newly created custom dialog is used in place of the current "Yes/No" dialog
